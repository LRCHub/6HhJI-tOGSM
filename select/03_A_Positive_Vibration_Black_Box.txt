I've got a feeling
D'you know the meaning
I want to let it out of my mind
I've got a secret
D'you wanna know it
I do it when I get high

I got it, you got it...

I got a positive vibration
Got this positive vibration

It's a positive vibration
Got this positive vibration

Do come and see me
I've got to do it
I'm gonna help you to ease your mind
Just got this feeling
Ain't gonna fool you
I hope you call me and try
