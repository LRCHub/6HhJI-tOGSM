Brighter days ahead
Step out from the shade
Brighter days ahead
See what you have made
Of yourselves, of your lives
Brighter days ahead
In these present eyes
Reach out from the haze
In these present eyes
See what you have made
Of these days, full of hate
Full of strife
Brighter days ahead
See the morning from your knees
Peace at noontime saves the sun
See the evening if you please
Love and peace and life are one
Brighter days ahead
Let all men realize
Brighter days ahead
That this truth they prize
In their eyes, in their eyes
Brighter days ahead
