Your vibrations drives me mad
Charmed by a beautiful desire
I try to show my feelings, he is just fooling around

Strong vibration - took me down
Strong vibration -

Unsecure, young and blue, she is loosing everything
Now I am the leading part
I slowly walk away

Strong vibration - took me down
Strong vibration -

Holding my line, keep it in your mind
I'm gonna be stronger, ain't going to take much long

Her heart turned so cold, she wasn't what I was dreaming about
I choose another path, and left her far behind

Strong vibration - took me down
Strong vibration - holding my line
Strong vibration
