I can hear a new vibration
Can you feel it all over the world?
We come together in these places
And we dance, and we live, and we love

I can hear a new vibration
Can you feel it all over the world?
We come together in these places
And we dance, and we live, and we love

Find your space in the darkest night
Ayo, ayo, say it one more time
Find somebody to make you come alive
Ayo, ayo, say it one more time

Find your space in the darkest night
Ayo, ayo, say it one more time
Find somebody, we can come alive
Ayo, ayo, one more time
Ayo, ayo, say it one more time
Ayo, ayo, say it one more time
Ayo, ayo, say it one more time
Ayo, ayo, one more time
